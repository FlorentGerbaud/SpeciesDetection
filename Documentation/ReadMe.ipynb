    "## The objectif of this project\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to allow real-time inference of underwater species. The Institucam films in real time, and the objective is to perform annotations in real time on the flow or to perform annotations on the samples where movement has been detected. To achieve this, I used the Tenaka model as a base and upgraded it to make it better suited for real conditions, such as detecting species under poor conditions, low-quality images, and so on. Additionally, I upgraded the model and created an API to improve the efficiency of treatment and avoid loading the model each time inference is performed.\n",

    "## ðŸ“Š Creation of DataSet\n",
    "\n",
    "The study and different tests that I can try to do show that the best results are achieved as follows. 30% of the dataset is used to show the features of the species, allowing the model to train on each species's particular features. This allows the model to know, for example, that sharks have some fins here, some gills here, etc. It also helps to avoid overfitting. Additionally, 10% of the dataset consists of other species to avoid overfitting and make the model better by forcing it to make some errors in predictions and recalibrate. Finally, 60% of the dataset is used in real conditions to train the model on what it will face in real life, especially when the buoys are set up on the water.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the creation of the global dataset is simple. I annotated some images for a given species, associated the correct class number in the configuration files and in the label files. Once I completed my dataset for each species that I wanted, I merged all of the datasets to create the global dataset with all the species.\n",

    "## Training Phase and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss the results obtained from our model, which are quite promising. We'll also cover how to interpret these results and ways to improve the model further.\n",

    "### The Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Precision-Recall (PR) Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The Precision-Recall (PR) curve is a crucial metric for evaluating classification models, especially in cases of class imbalance. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Precision and Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision**: Precision measures the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions made by the model. It answers the question: \"Of all the instances the model predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?\" The formula for precision is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Positives}}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recall**: Recall (also known as sensitivity or the true positive rate) is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positives in the dataset. It answers the question: \"Of all the actual positive instances, how many were correctly identified by the model?\" The formula for recall is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Negatives}}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PR Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The PR curve plots precision against recall for various threshold values of the model's output probabilities. Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trade-off Between Precision and Recall**: The PR curve shows the trade-off between precision and recall. As the threshold for classifying an instance as positive changes, both precision and recall values vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Area Under the Curve (AUC-PR)**: The area under the PR curve (AUC-PR) provides a single scalar value that summarizes the model's performance. An AUC-PR close to 1 indicates high precision and recall across different thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Imbalanced Classes**: The PR curve is especially useful for imbalanced datasets where the number of positive instances is much smaller than the number of negative instances. It provides a more informative view of model performance compared to the ROC curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ideal Model**: An AUC-PR of 1 indicates a perfect model with both high precision and recall. This means all positive predictions are correct, and all actual positives are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-world Scenarios**: In practice, the PR curve helps understand the model's performance at various operating points. For instance, in medical diagnostics, high recall might be prioritized to avoid missing any positive cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a model predicting the presence of sharks in images. If the PR curve has an area close to 1, it implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the model predicts a shark, it is nearly always correct (high precision).\n",
    "- The model correctly identifies almost all actual shark images (high recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization in CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), optimizing the PR curve involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjusting the decision threshold to balance precision and recall based on specific application needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Architecture**: Designing robust CNN architectures that handle class imbalances, possibly through class-weighted loss functions or data augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Regularly monitoring the PR curve during training and validation to ensure improvements in both precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on the PR curve, you ensure that your CNN model is accurate and reliable in real-world scenarios where the costs of false positives and false negatives may vary significantly.\n",
